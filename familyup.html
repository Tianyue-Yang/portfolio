          <h1>FamilyUp App</h1>
          <h2>UI/UX Design</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="intro">
          <p>Because of the one-child policy in China, kids in Beijing grew up without a sibling to play with, therefore felt a lot of loneliness and lacked opportunities to socially interact with peers. The effects of loneliness in children can be severe, that's why I designed an app for families to socialize and bring their kids together and eliminate their feel of loneliness.</p>
          <p>As a <span class="bold">UX designer</span>, I conducted research on the real issue of the only child‚Äôs feeling of loneliness, and brainstormed possible solutions, both online and offline solutions, for the problem. </p>

          <h3>- Solution Overview</h3>
          <p>This is a <span class="bold">family social app</span> for families in Beijing. The features of the app serve for creating more situations for kids to play with new friends and maintain their friendship, and providing parents the chance to monitor when their kids are making friends online. </p>

          <h3>- Important Design Decisions</h3>
          <div class="decision">
            <h4>1. Grouped up some separate features</h4>
            <p>In my previous design, The function for users to join groups and go to group chats, and the function for users to explore the family map were all on individual pages because they were the key features of the app. But my potential users concluded those features are just being functions for users to ‚Äúexplore new friends‚Äù, that‚Äôs why I integrated those features in the friends page rather than making them be individual special features. A grouping of functions made them become more meaningful.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="decision">
            <h4>2. Took out the "Log in as guest" option</h4>
            <p>In my previous design, users can log in as guest users but they can only view partial content on the app before they get to sign up and get their information verified. But when I was doing paper prototype testing, my peer student suggested that the app should have more convenient methods for users to log in, for example by Google or Facebook. I implemented the suggestion in my later design, and in this way there will seldom be users who don‚Äôt have any way to log in. And by making it possible for users to log in using their Facebook account and Google account, their information can easily be verified without making them sign up. That‚Äôs why I took away the ‚Äúlog in as guest‚Äù option.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="decision">
            <h4>3. Deleted the hamburger button</h4>
            <p>In my previous design, I folded all features into a hamburger button on top rather than laying them out because I thought it was a more efficient way to use the space of screen. But I changed my mind after my test users complained that they found it difficult to get to other features. That‚Äôs why the features line up at the bottom of the screens in my final design, because it‚Äôs more obvious that users can click on the icons to get to different features.</p>
